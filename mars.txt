Cold and dry but everything is my favourite colour.
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman.
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity.

let's resolve this by saying that there is no heaven.

this line is added by Anne to show an example of conflict
THERE IS NO GOD.
There is only pluto


Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?  
ooooooh heaven is a place on earth.
they say in heaven, love comes first,
we'll make heaven a place on earth.
